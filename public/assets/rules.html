        <p>The game is primarily a turn based fighting game.

            Much like a traditional turn based strategy game, players take turns when playing and are able to perform a
            certain set of actions on their turn.

            Once a person sees the main menu they are able to choose between several weapons and trinkets, before they
            can proceed to the main gameplay.

            The weapons and weapon attacks are broken down into elemental damage categories.</p>
        <br><br><br>


        <p> Weapons:<br><br>

            <img class="itemImages" src="img/sword.png"><br>
            Phlegestos, The Sword Of Flames (Boosts Attack) Fire<br><br>

            It is unknown who forged the great Sword of Flames. Some say Hephaestus, others the Dark Lord himself. What
            is known is the devastating abilities it has and its devouring flame that burns opponents to cinders. Out of
            all the weapons, this is truly the hardest to master, let alone wield.<br><br>

            <img class="itemImages" src="img/spear.png"><br>
            Tidus, The Spear Of Ocean (Boosts Defense) Water<br><br>

            Neptune forged the Legendary Spear of Ocean deep in the bowels of the sea. Imbued with all the rage and fury
            of the stormy seas and great typhoons, it requires a strong user to bend its aquatic fortitude to their
            will.<br><br>

            <img class="itemImages" src="img/bow.png"><br>
            Acceleron, The Bow Of Wind (Boosts Agility) Air<br><br>

            Apollo has been attributed as the maker of this mighty weapon, however whether this is true or a fabrication
            has been lost to time… The range it employs combined with its magical abilities can create a truly
            devastating crescendo of onslaught.<br><br>

            <img class="itemImages" src="img/axe.png"><br>
            Terragos, The Axe Of Land (Boosts Vigor) Earth<br><br>

            The shield of earth was forged by the earth mother gaia herself to defend the planet against any who seek to
            destroy it. More defensive then offensive the shield can wielded as a powerful tool by one who’s resolve is
            as strong as mountains.</p>

        <br><br><br>

        <p>Accessories:<br><br>

            Gauntlet Of Smoldering Embers</p><br><br>
            <img class="itemImages" src="img/gauntlet.jpg"><br><br><br>
            

            Shield of Waves<br><br>
            <img class="itemImages" src="img/shield.jpg"><br><br><br>
            

            Amulet of the Sun<br><br>
            <img class="itemImages" src="img/amulet.jpg"><br><br><br>
            

            Ring of the Winds<br><br>
            <img class="itemImages" src="img/ring.jpg"><br><br><br>
            



            

        <br><br><br>

        <p> Each character that is made has one weapon and one accesory, but both cannot be from the same element
            (example fire and fire).

            How damage is dealt is essentially like rock paper scissors, and is allotted in the following way:</p>
        <br>

        <p>Earth damage does double damage against air
            Air damage does double damage against water
            Water damage does double damage against fire
            Fire damage does double damage against earth</p>

        <br>
        <p>Choose wisely, as your weapon and trinket combination choice will impact how well a player does in their
            match.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The left and right buttons present your methods of attack. The element you attack with will then become the
            one you defend with on your opponent's turn.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Two buttons based on the weapon or element you chose and you can choose to attack by clicking either of
            those buttons D8+ attack, reduced by the opponents defense.</p>

        <br>

        <p>There is also a chance to miss, D20 vs. the opponents armor class ((agility + defense/2) + 10)

            If you meet or beat the AC you land the hit and do the damage.

            Other player (the computer) then has their turn

            After their turn commences it goes back to you to do actions.

            Gameplay resumes back and forth until a players health( vigor*5) is reduced to zero

            Health vigor *5

            Get your opponent's health to zero and you progress to the next round!

            Reach the finals and you may face the Dark Lord himself...

            Now go forth, and test your might!</p>
